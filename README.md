- Structured data storage and retrieval
- Clear separation of data + query logic

## What I Learned
- Designing search experiences that feel intuitive to users
- Structuring data for retrieval use cases
- Working with semantic/vector search concepts

## Status
In Progress

## Next Steps
- Add sample dataset and example queries
- Document setup steps (install/run)
- Add evaluation notes (what worked / what to improve)
- Optional: simple UI layer for search input/results
